## Ch 1

### All:

Info:
    Welcome to Geegle!

    We're so happy to have you as one of our newest Work Experience placements. We don't want to give you anything boring to work on, so we're going to throw you into the thick of it and see how you go. After all, the best way to learn how to swim is to jump in the deep end right?
    To start with we've got a couple of basic tasks for you - some general knowledge and basic programming challenges.  Work your way through most of those, and then we'll get you into the real work. Have fun!

    All the best,

    Chris
    HR Manager

trivia + scripting stuff is the first thing they do


## Ch 2

Second email to be sent 10 seconds after the first.
misc-email-intercept is not required to progress, but gains extra points.


### misc-incident-response:

Info:
    Hey newbie,
    So I know you haven't quite finished the intro tasks yet, but we've just got word from our monitoring team that someone is trying to use a Dictionary brute force to login to our staff portal. I've got the traffic logs here and it's all hands on deck, so I'm going to have to pull you away from the intro tasks to help us out. Can you take a look and figure out which IP address the attacker is coming from so we can IP ban them?

    Thanks so much,

    Adam
    Work Experience Manager

You are tasked with finding who is attacking us... Here is a file- email us the ip thats attacking us

### misc-email-intercept:

Info:
    Hi,

    Apologies, I seem to have attached the wrong file to the last email. Please do not read the last file, it was a confidential matter. Instead, please see attached the new file.

    Thanks,

    Adam
    Work Experience Manager

You intercepted an email between HR and your manager... can you decode what they were saying?

## Ch 3

### web-intern-account-manager:

Info:
    

is a SSO Intern Management website to increase their pay, Where if you Login, it will inform you have intern's are not able to access this site.

### web-intranet:

is a Local intranet browser, the idea is that interns don't have access to the employee VPN, so to access documentation on internal Geegle services, they must access the documents via this page

## Ch 4

### web-filesystem:

you found a link to an open file browser on the internal network, are there any cool files here?
      - idea maybe have etcpasswd in here?

### crypto-etcpasswd:

you have leaked two files from a server, can you login to the server?

## Ch 5

### crypto-intercepted:

So the employees found that one of the interns was intercepting and reading shit they wern't supposed to, they started to communicate using a custom cipher they developed... We managed to intercept both the cipher text and the key.. Can you decode it??
