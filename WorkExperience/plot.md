------------------

parallel: 
   trivia + coding stuff is the first thing they do


New hire to incidence response team:
   You are tasked with finding who is attacking us... Here is a file- email us the ip thats attacking us

email-intercept:
   you intercepted an email between HR and your manager... can you decode what they were saying?

Cookies:
   is a SSO Intern Management website to increase their pay, Where if you Login, it will inform you have intern's are not able to access this site.

easy_ssrf:
   is a Local intranet browser, the idea is that interns don't have access to the employee VPN, so to access documentation on internal Geegle services, they must access the documents via this page

recursive:
   you found a link to an open file browser on the internal network, are there any cool files here?
      - idea maybe have etcpasswd in here?

etcpasswd:
   you have leaked two files from a server, can you login to the server?

crypto-table:
   So the employees found that one of the interns was intercepting and reading shit they wern't supposed to, they started to communicate using a custom cipher they developed... We managed to intercept both the cipher text and the key.. Can you decode it??




maybe some binary stuff
