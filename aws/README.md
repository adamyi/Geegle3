# AWS Terraform Deployment

This was used for SECedu CTF 2019 to deploy team servers on AWS.

If you want to use this script to deploy your own CTF, remember to change all the AWS resources ID in the terraform script
to fit your own AWS environment.

If you ported this script to other Cloud Platforms (e.g. GCP, Azure) and would like to share your work with us. Feel free
to send a pull request to merge your deploy script. Thanks in advance :)
