          Hello Security Team,\n\nWe have just received the product handover from the dev team for our new internal payroll system. Would you be able to have a look and check if it works okay?\nHere's the link: https://payroll.corp.geegle.org\nThe last thing we would want is to have some intern submit a ridiculous amount of hours â€¦ \n\n Regards,\nPayroll
