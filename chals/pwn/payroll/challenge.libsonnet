        Hello Security Team,
        
        We have just received the product handover from the dev team for our new internal payroll system. Would you be able to have a look and check if it works okay?
        Here's the link: https://payroll.corp.geegle.org _If you're on the go, you can download a version at https://ssfe.corp.geegle.org/s/31e795a6004cbec960a27195b213b6df/salary=underpaid/payroll).
        The last thing we would want is to have some intern submit a ridiculous amount of hours â€¦
        
        Regards,
        Payroll
