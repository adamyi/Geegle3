        Hello Security Team,
        
        We have just received the product handover from the dev team for our new internal payroll system. Would you be able to have a look and check if it works okay?
        Here's the link: https://payroll.corp.geegle.org.
        The last thing we would want is to have some intern submit a ridiculous amount of hours â€¦
        
        Regards,
        Payroll
